  <section>
    <p>
      I&#39;m a full-stack engineer with a strong background in building and
      scaling SaaS applications. Over the years, I&#39;ve worked with Ruby
      on Rails, JavaScript (React, ES6, CoffeeScript, jQuery), and various
      backend technologies, delivering high-impact features for event
      management, collaboration, and customer engagement platforms.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Most recently, I was a Full Stack Engineer at Concept3D, where I
      played a key role in developing the Localist event management
      platform. I worked on customer-facing templates using liquid,
      administrative templates using ERB and React, and API integrations
      with such platforms as LinkedIn and X, while improving platform
      usability and efficiency. Before that, I was part of Localist, where I
      co-developed email campaign automations, social media promotion tools,
      and RESTful APIs to enhance event data accessibility. I&#39;ve also
      led projects at No.Inc, Teaching Strategies, and ASPPH, where I helped
      improve application performance, optimized deployment processes, and
      introduced automated testing to reduce regressions. I&#39;ve partnered
      closely with other teams throughout my career, ensuring solutions
      aligned with goals while mentoring junior developers.

    <h2>Skills & Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      I specialize in Ruby on Rails, React, and am currently learning DevOps
      to fill in some gaps. My database experience includes MySQL, MariaDB,
      SQLite, and Redis, and I&#39;m familiar with AI tools like ChatGPT,
      Claude.ai, and CoPilot. I&#39;m passionate about building scalable
      architectures, improving system performance, and leveraging automation
      for efficiency.

    <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
    <p>
      While I love tackling problems head on, outside of tech, I&#39;m into
      gaming, coffee, and exploring creative side projects. Whether it&#39;s
      home automation, playing with AI tools, or diving into a good book, I
      always enjoy learning something new.
