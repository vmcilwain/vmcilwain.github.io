        <p>
          I&#39;m a full-stack engineer with a strong background in building and
          scaling SaaS applications. Over the years, I&#39;ve worked with Ruby
          on Rails, JavaScript (React, ES6, CoffeeScript, jQuery), and various
          backend technologies, delivering high-impact features for event
          management, collaboration, and customer engagement platforms.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Most recently, I was a Full Stack Engineer at Concept3D, where I
          played a key role in developing the Localist event management
          platform. I worked on customer-facing templates using liquid,
          administrative templates using ERB and React, and API integrations
          with such platforms as LinkedIn and X, while improving platform
          usability and efficiency. Before that, I was part of Localist, where I
          co-developed email campaign automations, social media promotion tools,
          and RESTful APIs to enhance event data accessibility. I&#39;ve also
          led projects at No.Inc, Teaching Strategies, and ASPPH, where I helped
          improve application performance, optimized deployment processes, and
          introduced automated testing to reduce regressions. I&#39;ve partnered
          closely with other teams throughout my career, ensuring solutions
          aligned with goals while mentoring junior developers.

        <h2>Skills & Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          I specialize in Ruby on Rails, React, and am currently learning DevOps
          to fill in some gaps. My database experience includes MySQL, MariaDB,
          SQLite, and Redis, and I&#39;m familiar with AI tools like ChatGPT,
          Claude.ai, and CoPilot. I&#39;m passionate about building scalable
          architectures, improving system performance, and leveraging automation
          for efficiency.

        <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
        <p>
          While I love tackling problems head on, outside of tech, I&#39;m into
          gaming, coffee, and exploring creative side projects. Whether it&#39;s
          home automation, playing with AI tools, or diving into a good book, I
          always enjoy learning something new.
